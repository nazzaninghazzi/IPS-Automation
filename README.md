Suppose we choose 3 columns (column #6, 7, 8). Each column asks about a specific feature in IPS.
As an example, I picked these 3 features to be: time horizon, asset allocation, risk tolerance.

We get the values of timeHorizon, assetAllocation, and riskTol from Google Sheet and pass them to 
functions in convert1.gs, convert2.gs, convert3.gs respectively to assign a numerical value to them.
